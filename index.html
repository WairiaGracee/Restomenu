            <p>
                I am a web developer based in Nyeri,Kenya, also a student at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology,pursuing the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
                My desire to pursue the path of web development started with an inspiration from a friend.He was ahead in lots of things and offered to give me a hand in some things. 
                I decided to just try it out...then trying out turned to desire and passion to do more.I joined an online course and began my journey. 
                The journey has been such an amazing experience and I have learnt quite alot.
                My drive in this field is my goal to become a solution provider and provide eligible solutions to as many businesses and personnels as possible.
